# Blobby

This actor (we like to call it "Little Blobby Tables") is a simple file server showing the basic
CRUD operations of the `wasmcloud:blobstore` contract.

Not only is this actor an example, it is also a fully-functional, HTTP-based fileserver that can be
fronted with any HTTP server implementation and any blobstore implementation (i.e. you could store
the uploaded files on a filesystem or in an s3 compatible store). It also has a full example of
integration testing for the actor

## Required Capability Claims

1. `wasmcloud:httpserver` to receive http requests
2. `wasmcloud:blobstore` to save the image to a blob
3. `wasmcloud:builtin:logging` so the actor can log

## Running this example

This example requires capability providers that fulfill the above contracts. The wasmCloud [HTTP
Server](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers/tree/main/httpserver-rs) and
[Filesystem](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers/tree/main/blobstore-fs) capability
providers implement this functionality but you're welcome to use any implementation (like the [S3
Blobstore](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers/tree/main/blobstore-s3)).

Once you've installed **wash** and ran wasmCloud after following the [installation
guide](https://wasmcloud.dev/overview/installation/), you can run this example actor and the
wasmCloud providers with the following commands:

```
$ wash ctl start actor wasmcloud.azurecr.io/blobby:0.2.1
# If you use a locally built actor, replace the actor ID below with your own
$ wash ctl link put MBY3COMRDLQYTX2AUTNB5D2WYAH5TUKNIMELDSQ5BUFZVV7CBUUIKEDR VBBQNNCGUKIXEWLL5HL5XJE57BS3GU5DMDOKZS6ROEWPQFHEDP6NGVZM wasmcloud:blobstore "ROOT=/tmp"
$ wash ctl link put MBY3COMRDLQYTX2AUTNB5D2WYAH5TUKNIMELDSQ5BUFZVV7CBUUIKEDR VAG3QITQQ2ODAOWB5TTQSDJ53XK3SHBEIFNK4AYJ5RKAX2UNSCAPHA5M wasmcloud:httpserver "ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8080"
$ wash ctl start provider wasmcloud.azurecr.io/blobstore_fs:0.3.2 --skip-wait
$ wash ctl start provider wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.18.2 --skip-wait
```

Once everything is up and running, you can run through all of the operations by following the
annotated commands below:

```console
# Create a file with some content
$ echo 'Hello there!' > myfile.txt

# Upload the file to the fileserver
$ curl -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -v 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/myfile.txt' --data-binary @myfile.txt

## Development

This actor has two subdirectories. Due to the actor having a wasm32 target, we couldn't have the
integration tests in the same directory. The `actor` directory contains the actual code for the
actor and the `testing` directory contains the integration tests.

### Prerequisites

This actor requires a working Rust tool chain as well as
[`wash`](https://wasmcloud.dev/overview/installation/)

### Building the actor

Building the actor is fairly straightforward:

```console
$ cd actor
$ wash build
```

### Testing the actor

Testing the actor is also easy:

```console
$ cd testing
$ cargo test
```

This will automatically build your actor and then run the tests.

Please note that these tests are currently being used as a testbed for actor integration testing. It
is likely we will try to wrap this up in some sort of testing tool in the future!
